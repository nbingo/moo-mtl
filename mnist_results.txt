test accuracies, somehow no code for validation set (?)
both tasks averaged

Half the learning rate at every 30th epoch as reported in paper.
    
lr=1e−4: 
lr=5e−4: 
lr=1e−3: 
lr=5e−3: 0.8704
lr=1e−2: 0.8941
lr=5e−2: 0.9083
lr=1e-1: 0.9064


Use the implementation in the code with at every 10th epoch multiply with 0.85

lr=1e−4: 
lr=5e−4: 
lr=1e−3: 
lr=5e−3: 
lr=1e−2: 0.8941
lr=5e−2: 0.9116   <-----
lr=1e-1: 0.9056
